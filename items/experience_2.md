### Softball League

For a couple of years, I joined my father’s softball team and competed against various teams in a summer softball league that runs from May to August. I loved spending time with my dad as I was able to participate in an activity he’s truly passionate about. I have only great memories of our practices because of my father’s excellent coaching skills and desire to help improve the skills of each player on the team. My favourite memory was when I played left rover in the outfield. One of the players had a powerful hit and the ball was hurtling towards my direction with incredible spseed. Fortunately, my quick instincts kicked in and I jumped high enough to secure the catch in my glove! I was in complete surprise and all of my teammates cheered, as well as my father who was very proud. When I first began playing in 2021, I had difficulty learning the proper batting techniques. It was a gradual process filled with frustration and embarrassment but now I’ve got the hang of it! 

A - couldn’t be better as I made many new friends, honed my athletic abilities, remained active throughout the summer, and spent time with my father.
