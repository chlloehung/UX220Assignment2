### Athlete of the Year 

From middle school to high school, I played in various sports teams, including volleyball, soccer, dodgeball, badminton, and softball. My coach, Mr. Hoover, played a significant role in my athletic journey as he guided me over the years. I deeply appreciate the time he dedicated, both before and after school, to help his students improve our athletic abilities. Playing sports holds a special place in my heart as it allows me to develop my own skills while connecting with others who share the same passion. My favourite memory was winning the female athlete of the year award consecutively since grade 7. A moment I didn’t enjoy as much would be the nervousness I experienced when walking up to accept the award, but it’s absolutely worth the heebee jeebees! 

A - couldn’t be better as it’s such an honour to be chosen as the female athlete of the year
