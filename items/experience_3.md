### Cruise Family Vacation ˚⟡.

During the Christmas break of 2022, my family and I went on a cruise for the first time from Florida to the Bahamas. It was a lovely vacation as we experienced a new living experience, entertaining events, and explored the various services the cruise offered. The meals were an aspect of the cruise, in particular, that was exceptional. For both lunch and dinner, passengers gathered in a beautiful area reminiscent of the Titantic’s dining room, where we could order an array of delectable dishes with a variety of choices for each course. The food was incredibly delicious and one of my favourite dishes was the shrimp calamari, a dish my sister and I ordered nearly three times each evening! My favourite memory from the trip was when my sister and I were sunbathing on the rooftop and a crowd gathered nearby at the sight of dolphins. We were lucky to catch sight of, albeit briefly, an adorable pair of dolphins swimming in the nearby distance. However, one aspect that was not very enjoyable was being slightly seasick as every once in a while, the entire family felt nauseous with slight headaches. 

B - for the most part enjoyable as the seasickness was quite bothersome but I am truly grateful that my family brought me on the cruise and for the opportunity to experience what it's like.
