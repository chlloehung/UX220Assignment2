### Homeless Connect 

One of my volunteer experiences involved participating in Homeless Connect TO, an event to assist individuals at risk of and experiencing homelessness in Toronto. The event gathered vital resources on housing, ID clinics, employment, healthcare, and other services all in one place for those affected by homelessness. I volunteered in October of 2022, and during the event, my role was a guide accompanying guests from the registration area to the variety of services provided. Essentially, I provided a one-on-one “concierge” experience for each guest. Throughout the day, my primary task was to assist one guest at a time, assisting them in finding specific service locations and answering any questions they had. The most common places I guided them to were places offering hair care, hot meals, and clothing. One of the reasons I found volunteering at the event to be valuable was the direct impact it had on the lives of those in need. I had the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of individuals, which expanded my perspective and furthered my understanding of the challenges they faced due to homelessness. Furthermore, this experience strengthened my ability to effectively work and collaborate with others, as I had to coordinate with the other guides to make sure each guest received the assistance they needed. Conversing with the guests was certainly one of my favourite memories from the event. It allowed me to connect with them on a personal level, rather than being a mere worker carrying out assigned tasks. What made it even more special was the friendly and welcoming nature of many of the people I interacted with. There were moments during the event when it became quite challenging and overwhelming for various reasons. In some instances, communication was hard due to language barriers, which made it difficult for me to understand their needs fully. Despite this hurdle, I made every effort to patiently and effectively piece together their needs to provide the best assistance possible. 

B - for the most part enjoyable as I was able to assist those in need while meeting many lovely individuals.
