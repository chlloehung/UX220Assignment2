### About Me

I’m Chloe, a student studying UX Design at Wilfrid Laurier University. I’m passionate about enriching the lives of others through user-friendly design. Each day, I experience and learn new things and find joy in connecting with people who are motivated and unafraid of sharing their ideas with the world!
